# Python Expert Guidelines

## Overview

This comprehensive guide consolidates expert-level Python development practices, targeting **Python 3.12+** with modern tooling and cutting-edge ecosystem practices from 2024/2025. It combines foundational coding conventions with advanced patterns for building production-ready, high-performance applications.

## Global Development Principles

### Core Directives
- Target **Python 3.12+** with compatibility for modern packaging workflows (uv/Poetry)
- **Standard library first** - only add dependencies when they make code simpler, safer, or faster
- Generate code that is **typed, documented, and testable** by default
- Produce **small, single-responsibility** functions; keep classes lean and focused
- Use **f-strings**, **`pathlib.Path`**, **`logging`** (never `print`), and **context managers** for resources
- Prefer **comprehensions** to `map`/`filter`; never use wildcard imports

### Copilot Integration
**Prompt optimization:** "Write a typed, small function that accepts `Path` inputs, uses only the stdlib (unless clearly justified), raises specific exceptions, and includes a short docstring."

## Modern Python Features & Language Mastery

### Python 3.12+ Features
- **Improved error messages** and performance optimizations
- **Enhanced type system** with better inference and error reporting
- **Pattern matching** (structural pattern matching) with match statements
- **Performance improvements** in interpreter and core libraries
- **Better debugging support** with enhanced tracebacks

### Core Language Features
- **Advanced async/await patterns** with asyncio, aiohttp, and trio
- **Context managers** and the `with` statement for resource management
- **Dataclasses, Pydantic models**, and modern data validation
- **Generator expressions, itertools**, and memory-efficient data processing
- **Descriptors, metaclasses**, and advanced object-oriented patterns

## Type System & Interfaces

### Modern Typing Practices
- Add **explicit type hints** for parameters and returns
- Use **built-in generics** (`list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, `set[Path]`)
- Use the **union operator** (`A | B`, `str | None`) instead of `Union`
- Handle forward references with **`from __future__ import annotations`**
- Use **`Protocol`** for structural typing; prefer **dependency injection** over concrete coupling

### Advanced Type Features
- **`TypeVar`/`ParamSpec/Concatenate`** for complex generics and decorator signatures
- **Avoid `Any`**; if unavoidable, scope narrowly and document rationale
- **`dataclasses`** for data containers; choose immutability (`frozen=True`) when possible
- **Type aliases** with `type ID = int` for clarity
- **`Annotated`** for metadata and validation constraints

## Standard Library First Approach

### Priority Libraries
- **`pathlib`** for all filesystem work; **`shutil`** for safe file operations
- **`contextlib`** for deterministic cleanup (including `AsyncExitStack`)
- **`functools`** for caching and partials; **`itertools`** for iteration tools
- **`collections`** for counters, deques, and default dict patterns
- **`argparse`** for CLI; parse paths directly into `Path`
- **`typing`** utilities for clarity; **`dataclasses`** for readable records

### Decision Framework
Only add third-party dependencies when they:
- Significantly simplify complex logic
- Provide essential security features not in stdlib
- Offer substantial performance improvements
- Are industry standards for specific domains (e.g., `requests` for HTTP)

## Code Architecture & Design Patterns

### Structure Guidelines
- **Prefer functions** for stateless operations
- **Use classes** when you need state, invariants, or polymorphism
- **Composition over inheritance**; keep inheritance shallow and purposeful
- Separate **pure computation** from **I/O** for testability
- Keep public APIs small, explicit (`__all__`) and documented

### Decision Guide: Classes vs Functions
**Use a class when:**
- Persistent state required
- Multiple related methods
- Lifecycle/cleanup needed
- Polymorphic behavior

**Use a function when:**
- Single small task
- No stored state
- Simple transformation
- Convenience wrapper

### Advanced Patterns
- **Design patterns** implementation (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- **SOLID principles** in Python development
- **Dependency injection** and inversion of control
- **Event-driven architecture** and messaging patterns
- **Functional programming** concepts and tools
- **Plugin architectures** and extensible systems

## Resource Management & Asynchronous Programming

### Resource Management
- Always use `with` (or async `with`) for files, sockets, locks, and sessions
- **`contextlib.suppress`** only for specific, explained exceptions
- Proper cleanup patterns with `try`/`finally` when context managers aren't available

### Async Programming
- Prefer **`asyncio`** with `async`/`await` for I/O-bound concurrency
- **Do not** add async if it doesn't simplify or speed up I/O paths
- For task sets: gather as a group, propagate exceptions, apply explicit timeouts
- For HTTP client code, prefer **`httpx`** (sync or async) when stdlib insufficient
- **Advanced async patterns** with trio for structured concurrency

## Error Handling & Logging

### Exception Handling
- Raise **specific exceptions**; never use bare `except`
- Preserve tracebacks with **exception chaining**
- Add context to error messages
- Use **custom exceptions** for domain-specific errors

### Logging Best Practices
- Configure logging **once at app entry**; use module-level loggers elsewhere
- **Structured logging** with JSON for production systems
- Include **request/correlation IDs** for traceability
- **No secrets in logs** - sanitize sensitive data
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

## Performance Optimization & Profiling

### Performance Guidelines
- Pick the right **data structure** (list/set/dict/deque/tuple)
- Use **`functools.lru_cache`** for deterministic, expensive computations
- Document **invalidation policy** for cached functions
- Favor clear loops unless vectorization demonstrably improves clarity and speed
- **Measure first** (profilers, high-res timers) before optimizing

### Profiling & Optimization Tools
- **Profiling** with cProfile, py-spy, and memory_profiler
- **Performance optimization** techniques and bottleneck identification
- **Memory optimization** and garbage collection understanding
- **Caching strategies** with functools.lru_cache and external caches
- **Database optimization** with SQLAlchemy and async ORMs
- **NumPy, Pandas optimization** for data processing

### Concurrency Patterns
- **Async programming** for I/O-bound operations
- **Multiprocessing** and concurrent.futures for CPU-bound tasks
- **Threading** for I/O-bound work when async isn't suitable

## Security & Configuration Management

### Security Essentials
- **Never** commit secrets; read via env vars or secret manager
- Use **`secrets`** for tokens/secure randomness (not `random`)
- **Validate and sanitize** all external inputs
- Build file paths with `Path` joins, not string concatenation
- **Secure headers** (HSTS), secure/HTTPOnly cookies, CSP where feasible

### Subprocess Security
- **Default to `shell=False`** and pass **argument lists**
- Avoid `shell=True`; if forced, strictly validate/allowlist inputs
- Quote defensively and use proper escaping

### Configuration Management
- **12-factor app** principles with environment variables
- **Configuration validation** with Pydantic or similar
- **Secrets management** with proper rotation and access controls
- **Environment-specific settings** with clear inheritance
