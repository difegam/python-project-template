# Python Project Template üêç

This is a template for a Python project. It includes a basic project structure, a Justfile with some useful commands, and a README.md template.

## Project Templates
I have create a project structure for to different package managers, `poetry` and `uv`.

### Poetry
The `poetry` template is located in the [`poetry` branch](https://github.com/difegam/python-project-template/tree/poetry). To use it, run the following command:
```bash
git checkout poetry
```

### Uv
The `uv` template is located in the [`uv` branch](https://github.com/difegam/python-project-template/tree/uv). To use it, run the following command:
```bash
git checkout uv
```


## Resources

### [Uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
uv is a high-performance Python package and project manager written in Rust. It serves as a comprehensive tool that can replace multiple existing utilities like pip, poetry, pyenv, and virtualenv

### [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
Ruff is an exceptionally fast Python linter and code formatter written in Rust. It offers significant speed improvements, running 10-100 times faster than existing tools like Flake8 and Black.

### [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

### [Justfile](https://just.systems/man/en/)
Just is a command runner for project-specific tasks. It is a simple tool that can be used to define and run tasks. It is a good alternative to `Makefile` and `bash` scripts.

### [Gitingore generator](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore)
This website can be used to generate a `.gitignore` file for your project. It is a good practice to include a `.gitignore` file in your project to avoid committing unnecessary files to your repository.


### Python package templates
This project is inspired by the following Python package templates:
